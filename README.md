# Shader Cleaner

I noticed that Asset Bundles in Unity were having unexpected dependencies, that turned out to be the default maps that you can setup on Shaders. This tool will help you track down the shaders that have default maps assigned and highlight/filter the ones that have the textures in a different asset bundle than the shader they are assigned to.
